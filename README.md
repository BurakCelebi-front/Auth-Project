# Auth-Project

Advanced MERN Authentication System
This project is a robust authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It includes advanced features such as:

Email Verification: Ensures account authenticity by sending a verification email upon registration.
Password Recovery: Allows users to securely reset their passwords through email-based recovery.
Welcome Emails: Sends a personalized welcome email to users upon successful registration.
This application demonstrates secure user authentication, leveraging industry-standard practices and technologies, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure token-based authentication and Nodemailer for sending emails.

Key Features:
User registration and login with email and password.
Secure email verification flow.
Password recovery via email.
JWT-based authentication.
Responsive UI built with React.js.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js, CSS3, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Authentication: JWT, Nodemailer
This project serves as an ideal foundation for building more complex authentication systems or integrating into larger full-stack applications.
