# Auth-Project

# Advanced MERN Authentication System

This project is a robust authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It includes advanced features such as:

Email Verification: Ensures account authenticity by sending a verification email upon registration.
Password Recovery: Allows users to securely reset their passwords through email-based recovery.

Welcome Emails: Sends a personalized welcome email to users upon successful registration.

This application demonstrates secure user authentication, leveraging industry-standard practices and technologies, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure token-based authentication and Nodemailer for sending emails.



# Key Features:

User registration and login with email and password.

Secure email verification flow.

Password recovery via email.

JWT-based authentication.

Responsive UI built with React.js.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, CSS3, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

Authentication: JWT, Nodemailer

This project serves as an ideal foundation for building more complex authentication systems or integrating into larger full-stack applications.
